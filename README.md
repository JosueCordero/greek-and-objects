# YOLOv5 Fine-Tuning for Object and Greek Alphabet Detection

Description

This project fine-tunes the YOLOv5 computer vision model with a custom dataset containing two distinct categories:

- Household Objects (20 different items)
- Greek Alphabet Characters

The dataset is preprocessed, labelled, and converted into the YOLOv5 format for training. The trained model enables object detection within these categories. 

Important: Only Jupiter Notebooks and yaml files are in the repository. The dataset and the final model are not included.
